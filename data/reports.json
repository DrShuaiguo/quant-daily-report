    "abstract": "We demonstrate that the choice of normalization for order flow intensity is fundamental to signal extraction in finance, not merely a technical detail. Through theoretical modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, and empirical validation using Korean market data, we prove that market capitalization normalization acts as a ``matched filter'' for informed trading signals, achieving 1.32--1.97$\\times$ higher correlation with future returns compared to traditional trading value normalization. The key insight is that informed traders scale positions by firm value (market capitalization), while noise traders respond to daily liquidity (trading volume), creating heteroskedastic corruption when normalizing by trading volume. By reframing the normalization problem using signal processing theory, we show that dividing order flow by market capitalization preserves the information signal while traditional volume normalization multiplies the signal by inverse turnover -- a highly volatile quantity. Our theoretical predictions are robust across parameter specifications and validated by empirical evidence showing 482\\% improvement in explanatory power. These findings have immediate implications for high-frequency trading algorithms, risk factor construction, and information-based trading strategies.",

We develop a framework that enables safe and energy-efficient operation under realistic boundary conditions and introduce a multi-level explainability pipeline combining input perturbation tests, gradient-based sensitivity analysis, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature attribution. An empirical evaluation across multiple compressor configurations shows that the learned policy is physically plausible, anticipates future demand, and consistently respects system boundaries. Compared to the installed industrial controller, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary overpressure and achieves energy savings of approximately 4\\,\\% without relying on explicit physics models. The results further indicate that system pressure and forecast information dominate policy decisions, while compressor-level inputs play a secondary role.

    "abstract": "Although the automation and digitisation of anti-financial crime investigation has made significant progress in recent years, detecting insider trading remains a unique challenge, partly due to the limited availability of labelled data. To address this challenge, we propose using a data-driven networks approach that flags groups of corporate insiders who report coordinated transactions that are indicative of insider trading. Specifically, we leverage data on 2.9 million trades reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by company insiders (C-suite executives, board members and major shareholders) between 2014 and 2024. Our proposed algorithm constructs weighted edges between insiders based on the temporal similarity of their trades over the 10-year timeframe. Within this network we then uncover trends that indicate insider trading by focusing on central nodes and anomalous subgraphs. To highlight the validity of our approach we evaluate our findings with reference to two null models, generated by running our algorithm on synthetic empirically calibrated and shuffled datasets. The results indicate that our approach can be used to detect pairs or clusters of insiders whose behaviour suggests insider trading and/or market manipulation.",

Our experiments compare snapshot GNNs, a simplified temporal GNN prototype, and standard baselines (logistic regression and Random Forest). Results show that structural network information provides useful early-warning signals compared to feature-based models alone.\n  This correlation-based instantiation of SRR demonstrates that graph-derived features capture meaningful changes in market structure during stress events.

Our theoretical contributions cover both one- and two-sample empirical relative entropies.

    "abstract": "While reinforcement learning methods have delivered remarkable results in a number of settings, generalization, i.e., the ability to produce policies that generalize in a reliable and systematic way, has remained a challenge. The problem of generalization has been addressed formally in classical planning where provable correct policies that generalize over all instances of a given domain have been learned using combinatorial methods. The aim of this work is to bring these two research threads together to illuminate the conditions under which (deep) reinforcement learning approaches, and in particular, policy optimization methods, can be used to learn policies that generalize like combinatorial methods do. We draw on lessons learned from previous combinatorial and deep learning approaches, and extend them in a convenient way. From the former, we model policies as state transition classifiers, as (ground) actions are not general and change from instance to instance. From the latter, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) adapted to deal with relational structures for representing value functions over planning states, and in our case, policies. With these ingredients in place, we find that actor-critic methods can be used to learn policies that generalize almost as well as those obtained using combinatorial approaches while avoiding the scalability bottleneck and the use of feature pools. Moreover, the limitations of the DRL methods on the benchmarks considered have little to do with deep learning or reinforcement learning algorithms, and result from the well-understood expressive limitations of GNNs, and the tradeoff between optimality and generalization (general policies cannot be optimal in some domains). Both of these limitations are addressed without changing the basic DRL methods by adding derived predicates and an alternative cost structure to optimize.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) lacks centralized oversight, often resulting in heightened volatility. In contrast, centralized finance (CeFi) offers a more stable environment with institutional safeguards. Institutional backing can play a stabilizing role in a hybrid structure (HyFi), enhancing transparency, governance, and market discipline. This study investigates whether HyFi-like cryptocurrencies, those backed by institutions, exhibit lower price risk than fully decentralized counterparts. Using daily data for 18 major cryptocurrencies from January 2020 to November 2024, we estimate panel EGLS models with fixed, random, and dynamic specifications. Results show that HyFi-like assets consistently experience lower price risk, with this effect intensifying during periods of elevated market volatility. The negative interaction between HyFi status and market-wide volatility confirms their stabilizing role. Conversely, greater decentralization is strongly associated with increased volatility, particularly during periods of market stress. Robustness checks using quantile regressions and pre-/post-Terra Luna subsamples reinforce these findings, with stronger effects observed in high-volatility quantiles and post-crisis conditions. These results highlight the importance of institutional architecture in enhancing the resilience of digital asset markets.",

In the case that the optimal exercise price converges to the strike price ($b(T^{-})=K$), we contemplate models with negative jumps of unbounded variation (i.e., processes that exhibit high activity of negative jumps or sudden falls in asset prices). In the second case, when the optimal exercise price tend to a value lower than $K$, we consider infinite activity jumps (though still of bounded variations), extending existing results for models with finite jump activity (finitely many jumps in any finite interval). In both cases, we show that $b(T^{-})-b(t)$ is of order $\\sqrt{T-t}$ with explicit constants proportionality.

Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow. Beyond the setting of stochastic portfolio theory, the stochastic optimal control problem is analyzed for arbitrary compact, possibly non-convex, domains, thanks to a boundedness assumption on the instantaneous covariation matrix.",

The continuum nature of the $φ^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $φ^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $φ^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $φ^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks.

By modeling this ``bottleneck'' to summarize firm- and macro-level information, CB-APM not only predicts future risk premiums of U.S. equities but also links belief aggregation to expected returns in a structurally interpretable manner. The model improves long-horizon return forecasts and outperforms standard deep learning approaches in both predictive accuracy and explanatory power. Comprehensive portfolio analyses show that CB-APM's out-of-sample predictions translate into economically meaningful payoffs, with monotonic return differentials and stable long-short performance across regularization settings. Empirically, CB-APM leverages consensus as a regularizer to amplify long-horizon predictability and yields interpretable consensus-based components that clarify how information is priced in returns. Moreover, regression and GRS-based pricing diagnostics reveal that the learned consensus representations capture priced variation only partially spanned by traditional factor models, demonstrating that CB-APM uncovers belief-driven structure in expected returns beyond the canonical factor space. Overall, CB-APM provides an interpretable and empirically grounded framework for understanding belief-driven return dynamics.",

    "abstract": "DRL agents circumvent the issue of classic models in the sense that they do not make assumptions like the financial returns being normally distributed and are able to deal with any information like the ESG score if they are configured to gain a reward that makes an objective better. However, the performance of DRL agents has high variability and it is very sensible to the value of their hyperparameters. Bayesian optimization is a class of methods that are suited to the optimization of black-box functions, that is, functions whose analytical expression is unknown, are noisy and expensive to evaluate. The hyperparameter tuning problem of DRL algorithms perfectly suits this scenario. As training an agent just for one objective is a very expensive period, requiring millions of timesteps, instead of optimizing an objective being a mixture of a risk-performance metric and an ESG metric, we choose to separate the objective and solve the multi-objective scenario to obtain an optimal Pareto set of portfolios representing the best tradeoff between the Sharpe ratio and the ESG mean score of the portfolio and leaving to the investor the choice of the final portfolio. We conducted our experiments using environments encoded within the OpenAI Gym, adapted from the FinRL platform. The experiments are carried out in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the NASDAQ markets in terms of the Sharpe ratio achieved by the agent and the mean ESG score of the portfolio. We compare the performance of the obtained Pareto sets in hypervolume terms illustrating how portfolios are the best trade-off between the Sharpe ratio and mean ESG score. Also, we show the usefulness of our proposed methodology by comparing the obtained hypervolume with one achieved by a Random Search methodology on the DRL hyperparameter space.",

Our experiments compare snapshot GNNs, a simplified temporal GNN prototype, and standard baselines (logistic regression and Random Forest). Results show that structural network information provides useful early-warning signals compared to feature-based models alone.\n  This correlation-based instantiation of SRR demonstrates that graph-derived features capture meaningful changes in market structure during stress events.

    "abstract": "Long-term price forecasting remains a formidable challenge due to the inherent uncertainty over the long term, despite some success in short-term predictions. Nonetheless, accurate long-term forecasts are essential for high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and traders. The proposed improved genetic algorithm-optimized support vector regression (IGA-SVR) model is specifically designed for long-term price prediction of global indices. The performance of the IGA-SVR model is rigorously evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline models, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and the forward-validating genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression (OGA-SVR). Extensive testing was conducted on the five global indices, namely Nifty, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), DAX Performance Index (DAX), Nikkei 225 (N225), and Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSE) from 2021 to 2024 of daily price prediction up to a year. Overall, the proposed IGA-SVR model achieved a reduction in MAPE by 19.87% compared to LSTM and 50.03% compared to OGA-SVR, demonstrating its superior performance in long-term daily price forecasting of global indices. Further, the execution time for LSTM was approximately 20 times higher than that of IGA-SVR, highlighting the high accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed model. The genetic algorithm selects the optimal hyperparameters of SVR by minimizing the arithmetic mean of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) calculated over the full training dataset and the most recent five years of training data. This purposefully designed training methodology adjusts for recent trends while retaining long-term trend information, thereby offering enhanced generalization compared to the LSTM and rolling-forward validation approach employed by OGA-SVR, which forgets long-term trends and suffers from recency bias.",

In our formulation, ``sufficiently volatile'' is interpreted as a lower bound on an ordered eigenvalue of the instantaneous covariation matrix, a quantity that has been studied extensively in the empirical finance literature. Upon framing the problem in the language of stochastic optimal control, we characterize the time horizon in question through the unique upper semicontinuous viscosity solution of a fully nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE). In a special case, this PDE amounts to the arrival time formulation of the Ambrosio-Soner co-dimension mean curvature flow. Beyond the setting of stochastic portfolio theory, the stochastic optimal control problem is analyzed for arbitrary compact, possibly non-convex, domains, thanks to a boundedness assumption on the instantaneous covariation matrix.",

The continuum nature of the $φ^4$ theory avoids the inaccuracies that occur in Ising-based models which require a discretization of the time series. We demonstrate this using the example of the 2008 global financial crisis. The $φ^{4}$ quantum field theory is expressive enough to reproduce the higher-order statistics such as the market kurtosis, which can serve as an indicator of possible market shocks. Accurate reproduction of high kurtosis is absent in binarized models. Therefore Ising models, despite being widely employed in econophysics, are incapable of fully representing empirical financial data, a limitation not present in the generalization of the $φ^{4}$ scalar field theory. We then investigate the scaling properties of the $φ^{4}$ machine learning algorithm and extract exponents which govern the behavior of the learned couplings (or weights and biases in ML language) in relation to the number of stocks in the model. Finally, we use our model to forecast the price changes of the AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA stocks.

    "abstract": "Due to the significant variations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) altitude and horizontal mobility, it becomes difficult for any single network to ensure continuous and reliable threedimensional coverage. Towards that end, the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has emerged as an essential architecture for enabling ubiquitous UAV connectivity. To address the pronounced disparities in coverage and signal characteristics across heterogeneous networks, this paper formulates UAV mobility management in SAGIN as a constrained multi-objective joint optimization problem. The formulation couples discrete link selection with continuous trajectory optimization. Building on this, we propose a two-level multi-agent hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework that decomposes the problem into two alternately solvable subproblems. To map complex link selection decisions into a compact discrete action space, we conceive a double deep Q-network (DDQN) algorithm in the top-level, which achieves stable and high-quality policy learning through double Q-value estimation. To handle the continuous trajectory action space while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints, we integrate the maximum-entropy mechanism of the soft actor-critic (SAC) and employ a Lagrangian-based constrained SAC (CSAC) algorithm in the lower-level that dynamically adjusts the Lagrange multipliers to balance constraint satisfaction and policy optimization. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be extended to multi-UAV scenarios under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, which enables more generalizable policies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in throughput, link switching frequency and QoS satisfaction.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) are increasingly used to model systems with rough dynamics and long-range dependence, such as those arising in quantitative finance and reliability engineering. However, these processes are non-Markovian and lack a semimartingale structure, rendering many classical parameter estimation techniques inapplicable or computationally intractable beyond very specific cases. This work investigates two central questions: (i) whether integrating path signatures into deep learning architectures can improve the trade-off between estimation accuracy and model complexity, and (ii) what constitutes an effective architecture for leveraging signatures as feature maps. We introduce SigMA (Signature Multi-head Attention), a neural architecture that integrates path signatures with multi-head self-attention, supported by a convolutional preprocessing layer and a multilayer perceptron for effective feature encoding. SigMA learns model parameters from synthetically generated paths of fBm-driven SDEs, including fractional Brownian motion, fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, and rough Heston models, with a particular focus on estimating the Hurst parameter and on joint multi-parameter inference, and it generalizes robustly to unseen trajectories. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and two real-world datasets (i.e., equity-index realized volatility and Li-ion battery degradation) show that SigMA consistently outperforms CNN, LSTM, vanilla Transformer, and Deep Signature baselines in accuracy, robustness, and model compactness.
